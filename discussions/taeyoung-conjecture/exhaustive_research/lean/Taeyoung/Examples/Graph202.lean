# Atlas 202: verified pure-chordal example

graph6: `Ep~w`.  The edge-list definition below is the Lean graph;
the graph6 string is stable external metadata until a verified decoder exists.

The bound comes from the checked clique-tree certificate
`Certificates.G6_11`: 3 bags, every maximal clique of size 4.
It is transported to this graph along the explicit relabelling `relabel`, whose
adjacency correspondence `iso_adj` is checked by kernel computation.
